### Ontology

Hello, my name is Irene Feng and I'm a summer intern at the University of Pennsylvania and more specifically, the Department of Genetics in Perelman School of Medicine.

This GitHub project is a repository for my work here, which consists of learning programming, working with assays, and understanding what ontology is and how we can use it. 

Ontology is the study of being, existence, or reality and looks at the basic categories of being and their relations. It deals with questions such as "What can be said to exist?" However, I am specifically working with OBI (Ontology of Biomedical Investigations). OBI seeks to capture all aspects of biological and clinical investigation. Within OBI, there is a term called assay. An assay is defined as a planned process with the objective to produce information about the material entity that is the evaluant, by physically examining it or its proxies. Assays are crucial to OBI since they are the processes in which we obtain information about reality.

In regards to this, I will be updating the code that we use to pull ontologies into excel sheets for further analysis.
