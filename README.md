### Ontology

This GitHub project is for my work at the University of Pennsylvania and more specifically, the Department of Genetics in Perelman School of Medicine. It consists of learning programming, working with assays, and understanding what ontology is and how we can use it. 

Ontology is the study of being, existence, or reality and looks at the basic categories of being and their relations. It deals with questions such as "What can be said to exist?" However, I am specifically working with OBI (Ontology of Biomedical Investigations). OBI seeks to capture all aspects of biological and clinical investigation. One main part of OBI is defining assays. An assay is defined as a planned process with the objective to produce information about the material entity that is the evaluant, by physically examining it or its proxies. Assays are crucial to OBI since they are the processes in which we obtain information about reality. Currently, OBI contains around 700 assay terms, but they are not consistently implemented.

In regards to this, I will be using OWL API to update the code to reduce manual labor and harmonize OBI assay terms based on the design pattern as shown in the figure above.
